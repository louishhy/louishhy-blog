## Problem setting
When I first tried to build up a blog, I have been thinking about renting a VPS and running a Wordpress instance on it. This is why you have seen the previous blog. But:
- VPS costs you, sometimes payment is done annually in one installment.
- In terms of a blog, dynamic nature of Wordpress is an overkill.
- Have to setup TLS termination proxy, Wordpress and a MySQL instance. Heavy :(

I have seen some of my friends spinning up their blog using `Hugo`. With the static page hosting service (free!) by `Cloudflare Pages`, I have decided to give it a try.

In this blog, I'll mainly talk about the **subtle problems** I have faced in these sessions besides trivial documentation.
1. How to setup a Hugo blog
2. Using the `Stack` hugo theme
3. Deploying to Cloudflare Pages
4. Setting up Front Matter CMS (Content Management System) for easy content creation in vscode

## 1. Setting up Hugo
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator written in `Go` that is blazingly fast. To start a new hugo project, simply follow the [quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) guide.

### `archetypes` front matter template
Hugo uses front matter, a "preamble" in the markdown file to store metadata and control the behavior of the content. In fact here is the front matter of this blog:

```yaml

description: ""
date: 2024-08-23T14:15:58.493Z
preview: "" # This is for `Front Matter CMS`
draft: false
tags: []
categories: []
image: "" # This is for `Stack` theme, the header you have seen in this post.
slug: setting-up-hugo-static-blog-page
---
```

One (probably annoying thing) about Hugo is that it can use TOML, YAML or JSON for front matter. I like yaml but the default generated content with `hugo new post/your-post.md` is TOML. In addition, sometimes you do want the autogenerated files have different front matter according to the content type.

The solution is to open the `archetypes` folder and edit the `default.md` file, or create new ones such as `post.md` file. Hugo will match the templates according to the type, e.g. `hugo new post/your-post.md` will use the `post.md` template. [Check the matching rules.](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/#lookup-order)

## 2. Using the `Stack` hugo theme
If I haven't changed the theme after I have written this blog🤔, I am using the [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) theme. More than grateful for CaiJimmy for designing this elegant theme. It also has a nice [documentation](https://stack.jimmycai.com/).

For those that would like to set up the frames quickly, here are some steps:
### Setting up sidebar
- Go to the theme folder of the `Stack` theme (should be something like `themes/hugo-theme-stack`), find the `config.yaml`.
- Find the `params.sidebar` section and fill in the details.


### Setting up main menu and widgets
`Stack` provides menu items on the left and interesting widgets on the right side of the page. To setup those widgets you have to follow some steps:
1. Create those pages under the `content/page` folder. The theme relies on those pages to build the widgets.

_content/page/archives/index.md_
```markdown
---
title: "Archives"
layout: "archives"
slug: "archives"
menu:
    main:
        params: 
            icon: archives
---
```

_content/page/about/links.md_
```markdown
---
title: Links
links:
  <!-- This is a sample links page to Github. -->
  - title: GitHub
    description: GitHub is the world's largest software development platform.
    website: https://github.com
    image: https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png
menu:
    main: 
        params:
            icon: link

comments: false
---

<!-- To use this feature, add `links` section to frontmatter.
`image` field accepts both local and external images. -->
```

_content/page/about/search.md_
```markdown
---
title: "Search"
slug: "search"
layout: "search"
outputs:
    - html
    - json
menu:
    main:
        params: 
            icon: search
---
```

> **Notes**
> - You can also add the `weight` parameter to `menu.main.params` to change the order of the main menu items.
> - The `icon` parameter refers to the SVGs in `assets/icons` folder in your **theme folder**. For example, `icon: archives` refers to `assets/icons/archives.svg`.

2. After the creation of those pages, go to the `config.yaml` file in your theme folder. We first customize the left menu:
```yaml
# Custom menu configurations
# The `icon` refers to the SVGs in `assets/icons` folder.
# `Stack` uses icons from tabler.io (https://tabler.io/icons), 
# which you can download for customization.
menu:
    main:
        - identifier: home
          name: Home
          url: /
          weight: 1
          params:
            icon: home
            newTab: false
    # Social menu doesn't have text, just a list of icons.
    social:
        - identifier: github
          name: GitHub
          url: <your-github-link>
          params:
            icon: brand-github
            newTab: true
```

```yaml
params:
    widgets:
        homepage: 
            - type: "search"
            - type: "archives"
              params:
                limit: 5
            - type: "categories"
              params:
                    limit: 10
        page:
            - type: "toc"
```
This enables the menu items and widgets.

### Fix the code block glitch
A glitch in the current version (`Stack v3.26.0`) is that the code block has a mysterious black background. This should be a temporary issue but here is the ([official](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/issues/695)) fix:
- Go to `hugo.yaml` (or `hugo.toml`, if you haven't changed the configuration file format) **in the project root**.
- Add:
```yaml
markup:
  highlight:
   noClasses: false
```

## 3. Deploying to Cloudflare Pages
In normal circumstances deploying this stack to Cloudflare should be a smooth process.

The `Stack v3.26.0` however breaks the Cloudflare automatic page building process, which is probably caused by using an old image version of Hugo. To fix this, in your page build configuration, add the environment variable:
```shell
# Change to the newest or compatible Hugo version at your reading time.
HUGO_VERSION=v0.133.0
```
and it should fix the issue.

## 4. Setting up Front Matter CMS
Front matter is a vscode extension that runs locally and manages your contents and does SEO. It has high flexibility but setting it up was a nightmare for me (due to my lack of coding skills 😭). Anyways, I provide some key setups aside from the general guidance Front Matter CMS provides, which itself is nice👍.

### Markdown front matter template and page bundle support
One thing that you have to notice is that Front Matter does not respect the settings you provided in the `archetypes` folder. It uses its own template located inside the `frontmatter.json` generated.

Here is the modification I provide, with three augmentations:
- Enable page bundle support. 
    - Page bundle is a way to organize your resources and an `index.md` in one folder. If you do not know what a page bundle is, check the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/).
- Added the `slug` field. Slug is very important in Front Matter since it use it to open the preview (which I cover in later sections).
- Added the `image` field, which is used by the `Stack` theme.

> **Note**
>
> I regard it as a very **INELEGANT** modification since I directly modify the default profile, which I should create a new `post` profile or somehow. 
>
> But I mainly use CMS for writing posts, so, lazy me 🤷.

```json
"frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      // When generating page content, use a page-bundle format.
      "pageBundle": true,
      "fields": [
        // ...
        // This is for the header post image in `Stack` theme.
        {
          "title": "Post image",
          "name": "image",
          "type": "image"
        },
        // This is for automatic slug generation.
        {
          "title": "Slug",
          "name": "slug",
          "type": "slug",
          "editable": true,
          "default": "{{slug}}"
        }
        // ...
      ]
    }
  ],
```

### Preview setup
Front Matter CMS uses the `slug` of the pages to generate the preview. What it actually does is:
1. Spins up a local server (you have to click the `Start server` button.)
2. Generates a link to the page you are currently working on, using the rules [here](https://frontmatter.codes/docs/site-preview#configuration). In short, `<preview host URL>/<frontMatter.preview.pathName>/<slug>`.
3. Open a browser based on the link.

It's important to know that you have to setup the `frontmatter.json` correctly to use the preview feature. Also, you have to **make sure that the preview pathname is correctly set**. If not, it will access `<hostname>/<slug>` rather than, for example, `<hostname>/post/<slug>` (let's assume you host posts under the `content/post` folder).

The difficulty is really to recognize the aforementioned fact - once you understand it it is not hard at all and it is well documented. 

Check the documentation [here](https://frontmatter.codes/docs/site-preview#page-folder) to modify the generated `frontmatter.json` by adding `previewPath` property according to the instructions.

## 5. Epilogue
Let's shift away from the technical story and talk about something rather personal.

Sometimes I do think trying new thing is a hard time, but it still provides that dopamine surge that supports you to work until five in the morning. I have had a long chat with one of my friend, on the essence of software engineering (I probably will write a blog afterwards on this topic). What he essentially said is that SWE is an art for solving the problems, and it really depends on your experience to know what is the best solution.

He is right, in my opinion. There are so many awesome tools out there waiting to be explored, although during the exploration I do have to bang my head against the wall just to compensate for my lack of knowledge. 
Spending for like 12 hrs to just setup a page and spending another 3 hrs to write a blog recording my mistake is "not a good time management". 
But I do think it is worth it to left some record here just to make myself setting up the next blog easier.
And, if I am lucky enough to have a reader like you🤗, hope this helps.
